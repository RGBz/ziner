@title: What I'm Learning

# What I'm Learning
I don't ever want to stop learning new things. Here's a random assortment of things I've been learning this year.

## Rust
In January I read through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book and building a number of small Rust programs including work on a game engine.

Rust appealed to me because I'd been hearing a lot about it from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and in [Stack Overflow polls](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) it was the most loved language.

After spending time with Rust, I understand why. A central tenet of Rust is "if it compiles, it's likely bug free". Of course this isn't completely true, but the design of the language prevents a lot of the common types of errors developers encounter. Rust achieves this with a number of neat features:
- Everything is immutable by default
- Memory leaks are avoided via "borrowing" where memory ownership is explicitly passed around and automatically freed without expensive garbage collection
- Static typing with expressive and powerful enumerations
- Cargo, a package manager that's easy to use

I really enjoyed working with Rust. However, I don't know that I'd recommend it for most applications as it can be slower to develop apps in than something like JavaScript (which is the primary language I use day to day).

## Swift, Swift UI and iOS Development
After spending a lot of time building React Native apps, I decided to just go all in and learn native iOS development. I've made native Android apps before in Java and I have a pretty good understanding of that ecosystem.

I've never tried native iOS development till recently and honestly now seems like the best time to learn. [Swift](https://swift.org) came out a few years ago and has a lot of the features I liked in Rust. [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) also came out very recently and is similar in design to React in that you declaratively code your UI to respond to changing data.

Swift UI is also designed to make it easy to make apps for all Apple products: iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, Apple TVs and Macs. Given that I have a Mac and iPad and am planning to make the switch to an iPhone, I figured it'd be fun to make native apps for this ecosystem.

## Postgres
I've worked with a number of NoSQL (MongoDB and DynamoDB) databases and got started using MySQL while in college. At work we use Postgres. Reading up on it and using it day-to-day, it's a pretty cool database.

I've started using it for projects at home 1) because I like it and 2) to learn it better. I'll continue to work with it likely for the foreseeable future.

## Quantum Computing
A few months back I stumbled upon this [document](https://quantum.country/) written by a guy I follow on Twitter.

It's an introduction to quantum computing that uses spaced repition questioning throughout to help you remember what you're learning.

It's honestly the most accessible thing I've found written up on quantum computing. I highly recommend it if you're curious.

## Race Studies
Institutional racism is something I've always accepted as a reality, but never done any research into it. After the death of George Floyd a number of folks at work started a book club to learn more about systemic racism.

So far we've read [So You Want to Talk About Race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35099718-so-you-want-to-talk-about-race?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=oHjDz3Dpdk&rank=1), [How to Be an Antiracist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40265832-how-to-be-an-antiracist) and started [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6792458-the-new-jim-crow?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=1nKLeH4qGB&rank=1).

I've been learning a lot, including how racism is a rather recent concept that only came to be to support the slave trade.

## Team Dynamics
Ever since I took a course on communication in college, I've been fascinated about how people work together to get things done. Conway's Law has been a revelation.

At work [Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420-team-topologies?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=ARjS0BAMfL&rank=1) was recently recommended to me. I'm still reading through it, but so far it's been really engaging and thought-provoking.
