# A Word From the Editor

Hey it's me again, rgbz. Thanks for reading the first issue of my magazine!

Future issues will include more random thoughts I have, more poems and more drawings as well as updates on some of the projects highlighted in this inaugural issue.

It was a lot of fun making this issue. I hope I continue to make more.

I'd like to thank this morning's coffee and stroll for giving me the inspiration to make my own magazine. Without you I'd probably have spent the day, fretting, laying in bed or playing video games.

Till next time!
