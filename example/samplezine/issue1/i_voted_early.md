# I Voted Early

Today I voted in the 2020 presidential election.

Here's a riveting story about my experience:

I live in NY where early voting is available so I took a look at vote.org to find out where I could vote. If I voted early I could go to a location 1.8 miles away or wait till election day and vote 0.1 miles away.

## The Deliberation
It was a tough decision. Here's how I decided:

### Early Voting Pros & Cons

#### Pros
- I don't have to work today so I have time to do it
- It's an excuse to get some exercise and walk
- Once I do it I won't have to worry about doing it
- I can have something else to write about in my new magazine

#### Cons
- It's 1.8 miles away vs 0.1 miles on election day
- It's kinda cold out
- I'd have to do something now instead of later

Given the list. I decide to make a go of early voting.

## The Journey
My wife, Alyssa, and I got up early (before 10am on a weekend) and got coffee from my new favorite coffee place. This place is a tiny little coffee place and is either Spanish or Italian. My guess is Italian. They make the coffee to order so you have to wait for it. The waiting is my favorite part. I feel like I'm always go, go, go so it's nice to be idle for a bit.

Alyssa had some packages to send and she never updated her registered address after we moved to a different neighborhood so she has to vote somewhere else (which funnily enough was actually closer to where we live than my location for early voting). At this point we parted ways and I began my ~30 minute trek for democracy.

It was a nice walk. It was the sun was coming through and despite my original assessment of the weather it wasn't too hot or cold. As I was walking the coffee kicked in and for some reason I got the idea that it would be cool to make a magazine about myself and the stuff I'm working on. There's a lot of things I want to make and I thought that maybe it'd help to use the magazine to accomplish a few things:
- Act as a check-in on the progress I'm making on certain things
- Potentially be a way to elicit feedback from folks on stuff while I work on it
- Make something fun to read and write

This happens a lot when I have coffee. I get these grand ideas. Eventually the coffee wears off and the actual projects take much, much longer to implement so I end up with a graveyard of half finished ideas. Maybe this magazine can act as a way to hold myself accountable!? Or maybe it too will end up in the graveyard... Or maybe its just another distraction...

Thoughts of work started to creep in as well. I've been trying to keep the weekends for myself and not think about work. That rarely happens. I'm a software engineer at a direct-to-consumer, fresh pet food company. I like the work, but I'd also like to make sure to complete the projects I've set for myself. Hopefully one of them can become a full time gig.

At this point I'm getting pretty close to the polling place. I've been periodically reorienting via Google Maps. My coffee is about half way gone.

I start seeing people coming my way with "I Voted" stickers. I must be on the right track. I see a blonde lady walking in the same direction. She's ahead of me, but my pace is quicker. I pass her on the side walk. The polling place comes into view. No line!

## The Epic Climax
An old man is in front of me. He's a little hard of hearing, but sounds pleasant. The poll workers direct us to stand on socially distant stickers and the floor of what appears to be a gymnasium. I wait to get my ballot.

When it's my turn the masked lady asks for my first and last name. I don't hear her very well. I spell out my first name. "Now your first name?" she asks. Oops that was my first name already. How embarrassing. "Sorry that was my first name!" I say. "It's ok" she said, "it's hard to hear things in here". Eventually we get it sorted. She asks for my address and birthdate. I oblige. She tells me to take a pen. They're custom "Vote NYC" clicky pens that double as a stylus! Above the pens is a sign that says "KEEP THE PEN". "You see that sign?" she asks. "Yep! Keep the pen!" I say. She spins the tablet she's been typing on and asks me to confirm what I see and sign. I use my brand new clicky pen / stylus to confirm and sign. How cool!

My custom ballot is printed and placed in a large yellowed folder. I'm then directed to my own personal privacy booth to do the deed.

The privacy booth is not flat. It's at a steep angle like a drafting desk. I set my coffee on the floor and open the folio. Inside is the cryptic and slightly confusing ballot. They really didn't go out of their way to make it easy to follow. Despite the challenges, I fill it out to the best of my ability. Turning the ballot over I see another set of options on the back. Good thing I checked! I reread everything to make sure I did it correctly. Now to make my voice heard.

With my ballot complete, I grabbed my coffee and made my way to the counting machine. The gentleman took my folder and directed my to insert the ballot into the machine. I put it in the mouth of the beast, but nothing happens. I push a bit, still nothing. I jiggle the paper and feel something inside give way and I'm able to insert the ballot farther. The machine awakens and swallows the ballot. I spinner appears deciding if I've done everything correctly. A moment passes. A new message appears, a harbinger of relief: "Your ballot has been counted. Thanks for voting!" I wink at the machine and start to leave.

"Wait a minute sir, your sticker!" I turn. The gentleman who'd taken my yellowed folio is now standing behind me with an outstretched hand. I look down to see my prize. How could I have forgotten.

In his hand was a little sticker: "I Voted Early".
