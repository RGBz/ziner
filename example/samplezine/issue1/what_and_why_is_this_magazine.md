# What And Why Is This Magazine?

Hi I'm [rgbz](https://twitter.com/rgbz). This is my magazine, **rgbzine**.

Why does this exist? Here's an interview with myself where I ask myself all the questions I'd imagine you'd want me to ask me:

## rgbz on rgbz

### Hi rgbz, could you give a brief introduction?
Sure. I'm rgbz. Currently I'm a software engineer, but I'd like to do much more. I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wife and 0 cats.

I want to do a bunch of things before I die. Making a magazine wasn't necessarily one of those things, but here we are.

### So why did you make this magazine?
To put it simply, I noticed a market that no one is serving: fans of me, rgbz.

It's kind of crazy that it's 2020 and there's no rgbz magazine.

Well not anymore. As of today, now there is.

### Very funny, but really why make a magazine?
I used to get magazines as a kid. Monthly magazines that I really looked forward to. Information is so instant access today. I miss havng the monthly magazines I used to look forward to.

### There still are magazines today...
Yeah well not ones I want to read. This one I'd want to read.

### Sounds kind of egotistical
Maybe, but is it really so crazy? Oprah has a magazine.

We live in the age of the individual.

### Ok whatever, so why would anyone else want to read this?
I don't think I'm all that unique. I imagine the things I'd want to put in a magazine other people would want to read. If not, oh well at least it's stuff I want to write.

### So worst case, at least you'll be happy?
Yeah exactly. It's something to do. I figured it'd be fun.

### Gotcha. What will be in your magazine?
It's hard to say. I only came up with the idea this morning. Heck I may not even finish the first issue. Maybe no one will see this at all. If you do see this, good for me! I accomplished a goal!

Some things I'm pretty sure I'll put in my magazine are:
- Updates for projects I'm working on
- Things I'm thinking about, like stuff that I think will sound wise so people will think I'm smart
- Random pictures I draw
- Opinions I'll later regret publishing
- Links to things

### Interesting. Are you collaborating with anyone else on this?
Nope it's just me for now!

### likely forever...
What was that?

### Nothing, just clearing my throat
Oh gotcha could has sworn you said something.

### Nope! So you mentioned reading magazines as a kid, what were they?
Every year my grandma would let me and my sister pick out a magazine to get for a year. Then when I got older, I paid for my own. They were:
- Boys's Life
- Popular Mechanics
- Nintendo Power

I was a very big fan of Nintendo Power. Back before a lot of video game news was available online it was cool to see games that were in development. I still remember the pictures of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time before that game came out. It was really cool to grow up during the switch between 2D and 3D games. I'd like to release a game myself and one thing this magazine would be good for is sharing updates to any games I work on while I work on them.

### Cool, what other projects are you working on?
Glad you asked! I'll touch on them in different articles in this issue. There's of course Checkverse which has been out since 2015 (but not gotten much love since then), there's a game called Conga Quest I built for a LUDUM Dare game jam a few years ago that I've wanted to build out into a larger game with a level editor and there's a project called "A Day For You" which will be an app for planning a day out for someone as a gift for a birthday or other holiday.

I also have a bunch of electronic parts I was hoping to make into a robot. Oh, and it'd be fun to write a movie, and a book, and flip a house.

### Sounds like you're all over the place. Maybe just focus on one thing?
Did Leonardo Da Vinci focus on one thing?

### Are you Da Vinci?
No I'm rgbz.
