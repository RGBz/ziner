# Poetry Corner

Welcome to the first ever Poetry Corner! Here are some wonderful poems for you to enjoy. I hope they linger.

## The Slippery Eel
The slippery eel

Laid like a banana peel

On old man Corkiner's dock

The eel, the old man could feel

In his arthritic heal

As he was given quite a shock

## Music
The sun doesn't care about music

The sun doesn't care about taxes

The sun doesn't care about your feelings

The sun doesn't care about her feelings either

The sun doesn't care about manners

The sun doesn't care about handing things in on time

The sun doesn't care about being a role model

The sun doesn't care about creating a welcoming environment

The sun doesn't care about anything

The sun bides its time, waiting to explode

## Gentle, Autumn Grass
I settled and sat

On the gentle, autumn grass

Now my pants are wet

## Haiku
People say "Haiku"

But no one says "Good bye ku"

Irish goodbye ku

## Just some ickers
The candle flickers

Whispering its secrets

The clock tickers

Telling its time

The remote clickers

Commanding the TV

The sticker stickers

On my shirt cause I voted today

## The Last Poem (for now)
The last poem is stoic

It understands the heavy burden it must shoulder being last

The last poem stares off, unmoving

It knows any sign of emotion will show weakness

The last poem knows what it must do

It tells the other poems to go back home

Till next issue
