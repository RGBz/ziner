<h1 id="the-day-for-you-app">The &quot;Day For You&quot; App</h1>
<p>Every year, for the last few years I&#39;ve made a special app for my wife&#39;s birthday. Some years it&#39;s a <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> app, some years it&#39;s a web app and most recently it was a straight-up native iOS app.</p>
<p>While she&#39;s sleeping I install it on her phone (or for the web app, I texted her a link to it).</p>
<p>This app is very simple. When you first open it there are 6 locks with times listed underneath.</p>
<p>During the day, the locks turn into presents when the listed time arrives. Tapping on the present &quot;opens&quot; it to reveal usually a picture and a message describing some gift.</p>
<p>Most of the gifts are meals or a &quot;card&quot;. But the gifts at the end of the day are the best ones.</p>
<p>For her, the app is a lot of fun. It&#39;s exciting to have your birthday last all day long with fun presents that fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>Every year she tells me I should make it so other people can do the same thing. Every year I start on it and then get distracted.</p>
<p>Maybe not this year!</p>
<h2 id="making-a-day-for-someone">Making a day for someone</h2>
<p>The basic idea for a more general app would be to allow people to create &quot;days&quot; for their friends and family by downloading the app, adding the timed &quot;gifts&quot; which when opened reval photos and messages.</p>
<p>This year I figured I could use the birthday app as an excuse to learn <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">Swift UI</a>. It took a few days to learn Swift and Swift UI enough to make it, but I succeeded.</p>
<p>The next step is to make it more general purpose. The current plan is to charge a dollar or two to let people make and send &quot;days&quot; to their friends.</p>
<p>The app would let you create, send and accept &quot;days&quot;. When you make a day, it&#39;ll be uploaded to a server and you&#39;ll be given a code to send to the recipient to accept the &quot;day&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="how-its-going">How it&#39;s going</h2>
<p>So far I have a basic UI for sending and receiving. I&#39;m focusing on mobile first so I&#39;m planning to build out most of the iOS app before getting started on the server part of it (which should be pretty basic anyway).</p>
<p>My goal is to have a working app before my sister in law&#39;s birthday on Nov. 15th. However I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll have it available on the app story by then, but it&#39;s a good goal. I should be working on it today, but instead I&#39;m making this magazine.</p>
