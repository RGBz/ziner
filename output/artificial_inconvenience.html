<h1 id="artificial-inconvenience">Artificial Inconvenience</h1>
<p>Things these days are too easy.</p>
<p>Want food? Crack open GrubHub or Seamless and have it delivered in a few pressed.</p>
<p>Want some new clothes? Have them delivered. Heck you don&#39;t even need to pick them out, some services will pick the clothes out for you. If they fit, keep them. If they don&#39;t, send them back (that part actually isn&#39;t all that convenient).</p>
<p>Want to go somewhere? Just order an Uber or a Lyft.</p>
<p>In this modern era companies are doing everything they can to make things easy. Even our decisions are being outsourced. They&#39;re not the only ones, but Apple deliberately designs opinionated products to eliminate customer decisions.</p>
<p>It&#39;s our nature to want to make things easier, but is it healthy to live a life with this much convenience?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p>Sure difficult labor is likely not healthy either, but there&#39;s a middle ground.</p>
<p>Our bodies aren&#39;t accustomed to this level of comfort. So what do we do? Some of us practice what I&#39;d like to call &quot;artificial inconvenience&quot;. One popular example of this is exercise.</p>
<p>We no longer need to chase down a deer and stab it in the neck to have dinner. We can just go to the store and get pre-butchered deer steaks or order a deer burger and have it delivered.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t need to cook, we don&#39;t need to clean, everything is commoditized and available for a price. With enough money you can buy a life free of burden.</p>
<p>The problem with artificial inconvenience is that it&#39;s artificial. We don&#39;t have to exercise. The damage done from a lack of exercise is slow and easy to ignore.</p>
<p>Some people are inherently good at delaying gratification and putting in the work they know they need to do. However I&#39;d wager that most don&#39;t have this much self control. So how do we make sure to opt-in to healthy, but inconvient tasks that aren&#39;t immediately necessary?</p>
<p>We make dopamine systems. Todo lists and goals being the primary form. We create little carrots and place them along a path toward the larger goals that may take a long time to complete.</p>
<p>These dopamine systems are everywhere. From course syllabi to grocery lists. Sure they serve as memory systems too, but they&#39;re mainly dopamine delivery systems. You get a little bump every time you cross off an item.</p>
<p>So the question is: how can you design dopamine effective dopamine systems to get done the things you want to do?</p>
<p>Well that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to figure out. Checkverse was meant to be a way to share your dopamine systems with other people. It didn&#39;t take off the way I was hoping it would, but I have some new ideas for a way forward there.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the important thing seems to be to understand yourself. To know how you work in order to trick your hunk of meat into doing what you know it should have been doing all along.</p>
