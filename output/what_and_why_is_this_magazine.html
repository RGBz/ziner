<h1 id="what-and-why-is-this-magazine">What And Why Is This Magazine?</h1>
<p>Hi I&#39;m <a href="https://twitter.com/rgbz">rgbz</a>. This is my magazine, <strong>rgbzine</strong>.</p>
<p>Why does this exist? Here&#39;s an interview with myself where I ask myself all the questions I&#39;d imagine you&#39;d want me to ask me:</p>
<h2 id="rgbz-on-rgbz">rgbz on rgbz</h2>
<h3 id="hi-rgbz-could-you-give-a-brief-introduction">Hi rgbz, could you give a brief introduction?</h3>
<p>Sure. I&#39;m rgbz. Currently I&#39;m a software engineer, but I&#39;d like to do much more. I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wife and 0 cats.</p>
<p>I want to do a bunch of things before I die. Making a magazine wasn&#39;t necessarily one of those things, but here we are.</p>
<h3 id="so-why-did-you-make-this-magazine">So why did you make this magazine?</h3>
<p>To put it simply, I noticed a market that no one is serving: fans of me, rgbz.</p>
<p>It&#39;s kind of crazy that it&#39;s 2020 and there&#39;s no rgbz magazine.</p>
<p>Well not anymore. As of today, now there is.</p>
<h3 id="very-funny-but-really-why-make-a-magazine">Very funny, but really why make a magazine?</h3>
<p>I used to get magazines as a kid. Monthly magazines that I really looked forward to. Information is so instant access today. I miss havng the monthly magazines I used to look forward to.</p>
<h3 id="there-still-are-magazines-today">There still are magazines today...</h3>
<p>Yeah well not ones I want to read. This one I&#39;d want to read.</p>
<h3 id="sounds-kind-of-egotistical">Sounds kind of egotistical</h3>
<p>Maybe, but is it really so crazy? Oprah has a magazine.</p>
<p>We live in the age of the individual.</p>
<h3 id="ok-whatever-so-why-would-anyone-else-want-to-read-this">Ok whatever, so why would anyone else want to read this?</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m all that unique. I imagine the things I&#39;d want to put in a magazine other people would want to read. If not, oh well at least it&#39;s stuff I want to write.</p>
<h3 id="so-worst-case-at-least-youll-be-happy">So worst case, at least you&#39;ll be happy?</h3>
<p>Yeah exactly. It&#39;s something to do. I figured it&#39;d be fun.</p>
<h3 id="gotcha-what-will-be-in-your-magazine">Gotcha. What will be in your magazine?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s hard to say. I only came up with the idea this morning. Heck I may not even finish the first issue. Maybe no one will see this at all. If you do see this, good for me! I accomplished a goal!</p>
<p>Some things I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll put in my magazine are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates for projects I&#39;m working on</li>
<li>Things I&#39;m thinking about, like stuff that I think will sound wise so people will think I&#39;m smart</li>
<li>Random pictures I draw</li>
<li>Opinions I&#39;ll later regret publishing</li>
<li>Links to things</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interesting-are-you-collaborating-with-anyone-else-on-this">Interesting. Are you collaborating with anyone else on this?</h3>
<p>Nope it&#39;s just me for now!</p>
<h3 id="likely-forever">likely forever...</h3>
<p>What was that?</p>
<h3 id="nothing-just-clearing-my-throat">Nothing, just clearing my throat</h3>
<p>Oh gotcha could has sworn you said something.</p>
<h3 id="nope-so-you-mentioned-reading-magazines-as-a-kid-what-were-they">Nope! So you mentioned reading magazines as a kid, what were they?</h3>
<p>Every year my grandma would let me and my sister pick out a magazine to get for a year. Then when I got older, I paid for my own. They were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boys&#39;s Life</li>
<li>Popular Mechanics</li>
<li>Nintendo Power</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a very big fan of Nintendo Power. Back before a lot of video game news was available online it was cool to see games that were in development. I still remember the pictures of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time before that game came out. It was really cool to grow up during the switch between 2D and 3D games. I&#39;d like to release a game myself and one thing this magazine would be good for is sharing updates to any games I work on while I work on them.</p>
<h3 id="cool-what-other-projects-are-you-working-on">Cool, what other projects are you working on?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked! I&#39;ll touch on them in different articles in this issue. There&#39;s of course Checkverse which has been out since 2015 (but not gotten much love since then), there&#39;s a game called Conga Quest I built for a LUDUM Dare game jam a few years ago that I&#39;ve wanted to build out into a larger game with a level editor and there&#39;s a project called &quot;A Day For You&quot; which will be an app for planning a day out for someone as a gift for a birthday or other holiday.</p>
<p>I also have a bunch of electronic parts I was hoping to make into a robot. Oh, and it&#39;d be fun to write a movie, and a book, and flip a house.</p>
<h3 id="sounds-like-youre-all-over-the-place-maybe-just-focus-on-one-thing">Sounds like you&#39;re all over the place. Maybe just focus on one thing?</h3>
<p>Did Leonardo Da Vinci focus on one thing?</p>
<h3 id="are-you-da-vinci">Are you Da Vinci?</h3>
<p>No I&#39;m rgbz.</p>
